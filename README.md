# Frame-by-Frame
The "Frame by Frame" system is meant to be a movie rating and recommendation platform that allows both individual and community interaction.
From a user’s perspective, it offers a single place to discover films, share opinions, and organize future viewing. The system’s main aims are storing detailed
information about movies, such as titles, genre, cast and directors. This information provides the foundation for browsing, searching and filtering movies according to the
users’ preferences.
In addition to storing movie details, the platform encourages user participation. Registered users have the possibility of creating accounts to share
ideas, opinions and also make recommendations through ratings and comments, encouraging movie discussion and building communities. Reviews and ratings also
contribute to aggregated scores, giving each movie a visible average rating within the system.
Moreover, the platform enables users to create and manage personalized watchlists. This feature helps them keep track of movies they plan to watch and
organize them according to viewing priorities in a structured way. Tagging or categorising based on moods supports discovering films which better match specific
themes or interests of the user. 
Together, all these elements establish a system that is both functional and
engaging, which combines reliable data storage with interactive features
